## Conceptualization
I first got the idea for this project when searching the wayback machine. I searched up these early to mid 2000s kids programming websites that hosted a lot of kids games. I also searched up old edutaintment games my kintergarden teacher would give us to teach us subjects such as math and science.

I took note of these website's designs. They are often very dinky, saturated in color, yet simplistic in the design and fonts they use. It was here where I finally decided to make an interactive game about the life cycle of different animals, and I chose the butterfly and frog as the primary options, because they are the biggest examples of metamorphisis.

## Process
In order to get my ideas together, I used Miro to create two maps for the route games. Aside from the butterfly and frog, other animals I considered doing were a lion, spider, and a fox. I ultimately didn't due to time constraints and burnout.
