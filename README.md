# About
For this project I decided to do a project that was basically a preschool edutainment game.

I first got the idea for this project when searching the wayback machine. I searched up these early to mid 2000s kids programming websites that hosted a lot of kids games. I also searched up old edutaintment games my kintergarden teacher would give us to teach us subjects such as math and science.

I took note of these website's designs. They are often very dinky, saturated in color, yet simplistic in the design and fonts they use. It was here where I finally decided to make an interactive game about the life cycle of different animals, and I chose the butterfly and frog as the primary options, because they are the biggest examples of metamorphisis.

 ## Process & Documentation
In order to get my ideas together, I used Miro to create two maps for the route games. Aside from the butterfly and frog, other animals I considered doing were a lion, spider, and a fox. I ultimately didn't due to time constraints and burnout.

I first used the basic HTML starter project as a template for my project, as a basic jumping off point, so to maje things simple while making thus project.

Then I focused on the design aspect of the project. I used photoshop to create all the assets and background. I took into account the tacky simplicity of those old preschool games. This is why I chose Comics Sans as the official font, to reflect the tackiness. There were other details due, like the cut off repeating pattern in the background, and the title of the website patterned with real life pictures of trees.

## Challenges & Struggles
I did run into technical problems. Like struggling how to correctly arrange the assets correctly, in which I had to sign up for a tutoring session to get help for. Then the most tedious problem I ran into were the sizes of the assets. Because I was working on this project on a bigger moniter, when I tried to play it on a normal labtop, the assets were basically cramped within the screen, so I had to resize each image one by one in order to accomadate the labtop screen.

This project has been the most difficult by far. Mainly due to having to connect with files with the repo. Even though I was able to solve the issue, I am still confused by how I was able to complete this project in the end. That being said, I am satisfied with the end product. I enjoyed creating a preschool edutainment game, it was a very nostalgia experience.
