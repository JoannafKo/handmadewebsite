        What is Animal Kingdom?
    </h1>

   <div>
    <p id="pargraph">
        Animal Kingdom is a website for children from ages 3 to 7. It an educational game for kids to learn about the biology, function, and survival of nature's most fascinating creatures. Watch as your child learns about animal terminology, care for baby animals behind the safety of their screen, create new animals themselves, and so many more! Not only that, but the website can also educate children on other important topics, such as writing, nath, and geography.

   <h1>
       Is Animal Kingdom safe for my child?
   </h1>

   <p id="pargraph">
       Animal Kingdom prides itself on educating children about the realities and harshness of nature. Thus, it will have depictions of killing, infanticide, cannibalism, and evolution. If you do not want your child to be exposed to these depictions, click off this site and maybe consider parental locks if you want to shield your child. Animal Kingdom is not responsible for any trauma a child may experience from seeing such realistic depictions of nature.
